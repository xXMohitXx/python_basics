#range is an inbuilt function in python which is used in loops for generating a list of integers to work on
#with the help of this list(range()) function we can print the lists without using loops or other things
print(list(range(1,10)))
#list with difference of 2 successive integers
print(list(range(1,20,2)))
print(list(range(0,20,2)))
